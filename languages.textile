Hi, I'm nanashiRei, a professional web developer focusing on client UI and everything related to HTML5. My most
used languages are:

%(badge.badge-info)HTML/CSS%
%(badge.badge-warning)SQL%
%(badge.badge-success)JavaScript%
%(badge.badge-important)PHP%

*Hold on!* These 4 languages are my favorites, but this doesn't mean i don't know other languages. In fact i know
%(badge)much more!% I've been working with PHP since 2002 and created my first website back in 2003.

I've got some powerful backup in store, in case it's needed. Let me give you a brief overview.

p(lead.text-green). Neico,

is a skilled programmer that focuses on compiler languages. His motivation, above all other, is the desire to
create games. But, like myself, he is a multitalent, doing his wizardry with:

%(badge.badge-info)C++%
%(badge.badge-warning)Lua%
%(badge.badge-success)Java%
%(badge.badge-important)SQL%

Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP is no problem either, but he lacks experiance with them.
